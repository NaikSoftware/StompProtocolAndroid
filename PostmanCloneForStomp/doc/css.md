# The CSS

HTML5 Boilerplate's CSS includes:

* [Normalize.css](#normalizecss)
* [main.css](#maincss)

## Normalize.css

In order to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with
modern standards, we include Normalize.css â€” a modern, HTML5-ready alternative
to CSS resets.

As opposed to CSS resets, Normalize.css:

* targets only the styles that need normalizing
* preserves useful browser defaults rather than erasing them
* corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies
* improves usability with subtle improvements
* doesn't clutter the debugging tools
* has better documentation

For more information about Normalize.css, please refer to its [project
page](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

## main.css

Several base styles are included that build upon `Normalize.css`. These styles:

* provide basic typography settings that improve text readability
* protect against unwanted `text-shadow` during text highlighting
* tweak the default alignment of some elements (e.g.: `img`, `video`,
  `fieldset`, `textarea`)
* style the prompt that is displayed to users using an outdated browser
* and more...

These styles are included in
[main.css](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/css/main.css).
See the [main.css](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css) project
[documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css/blob/master/README.md#features)
for a full discussion of these styles.
